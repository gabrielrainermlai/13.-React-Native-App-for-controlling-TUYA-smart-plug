We need a developer to improve our existing React Native app for iOS and Android that controls our TUYA-based smart plug. You should have experience with TUYA's API.

Tasks:
Make it easier for users to connect the smart plug via Bluetooth instead of entering their Wi-Fi code and creating an account.
Create an algorithm that turns the smart plug on and off based on the user's location, local weather, and inside temperature (measured by the smart plug's built-in temperature sensor).
Our smart plug is a standard Bluetooth-capable plug with built-in TUYA firmware.

Acceptance Criteria:
The user can connect the smart plug via Bluetooth without entering their Wi-Fi code or creating an account.
The algorithm turns the smart plug on and off based on the user's location, local weather, and inside temperature.
The app accurately measures the inside temperature using the smart plug's built-in temperature sensor.
The app uses TUYA's API to control the smart plug's on/off functionality.
The app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
The user interface is intuitive and easy to use.
The app is stable and reliable, with no significant bugs or crashes.
Deliver well-documented code.
